                Chris Rosetta & Amy Rosetta – The Owners of the 100% Locally Owned
                best Independent Pizza Shop in Bendigo. They have experienced it all
                since moving away from Eagle Boys. Instead of going under with the
                failed Franchisor, the decision to go independent was made.
